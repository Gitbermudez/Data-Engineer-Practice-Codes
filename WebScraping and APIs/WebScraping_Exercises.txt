Practice One:
The information required is Average Rank, Film, and Year.
You are required to write a Python script webscraping_movies.py that extracts the information and saves 
it to a CSV file top_50_films.csv. You are also required to save the same information to a database Movies.db 
under the table name Top_50.


Pratice Two:
Modify the code to extract Film, Year, and Rotten Tomatoes' Top 100 headers.

Restrict the results to only the top 25 entries.

Filter the output to print only the films released in the 2000s (year 2000 included).
